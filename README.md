Example `React` component "library" using [`rollup`](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) that is published to `npm`.

## `rollup` and `webpack`

There are a lot of articles that compare `rollup` and `webpack` (like [this](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-and-rollup-the-same-but-different-a41ad427058c) or [this](https://webpack.js.org/comparison/) or [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43255948/5225575) or [this](https://nolanlawson.com/2016/08/15/the-cost-of-small-modules/)).

The general point is
> `webpack` is generally a better fit for applications, and `rollup` is generally a better fit for libraries

## So what is this project?

I've never used `rollup` before - hell, I've *barely* used `webpack` before.

This was mostly to see how easy / difficult it was to create a `React` component package using `rollup` (aka "proof-of-concept").

My requirements for this package were

1. Use `babel`
2. Use `semantic-release`
3. Use `sass`
4. Support `umd` and `es` modules
5. Use `storybook`
6. Make the exported components really simple
